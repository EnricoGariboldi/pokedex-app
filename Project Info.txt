this project aims to recreate a pokedex saw online.

all the pokemons data is fetched from https://pokeapi.co/ .
The application features a fully responsive grid where are shown all the pokemons,
a dinamic search bar that filter the results, and a specific page
for each pokemon. By clicking on a card, you'll open the pokemon
personal page displaying its image, stats and some other informations.

the project is designed for all breakpoints.
